'''DRIP-seq (DRIP-sequencing)''' is a technology for genome-wide profiling of a type of DNA-RNA hybrid called "[[R-loop]]"<ref name="Ginno et al 2012">{{cite journal|last1=Ginno|first1=PA|last2=Lott|first2=PL|last3=Christensen|first3=HC|last4=Korf|first4=I|last5=Chédin|first5=F|title=R-loop formation is a distinctive characteristic of unmethylated human CpG island promoters.|journal=Molecular cell|date=30 March 2012|volume=45|issue=6|pages=814–25|pmid=22387027}}</ref>. DRIP-seq utilizes a sequence-independent but structure specific [[antibody]] for DNA-RNA [[immunoprecipitation]] (DRIP) to capture R-loops for massively parallel [[DNA sequencing]]<ref name="Ginno et al 2012"/>.

==Introduction==
R-loops are three-stranded [[nucleic acid]] structures predominantly formed in cytosine-rich DNA regions during [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. They are composed of a DNA-RNA hybrid duplex and a displaced single stranded DNA (ssDNA)<ref name=Aguilera>{{cite journal|last1=Aguilera|first1=A|last2=García-Muse|first2=T|title=R loops: from transcription byproducts to threats to genome stability.|journal=Molecular cell|date=27 April 2012|volume=46|issue=2|pages=115–24|pmid=22541554}}</ref>. R-loops are found in a broad range of species ranging from bacteria to mammals and are involved in [[gene expression]] and immunoglobulin class switching<ref name="Ginno et al 2012"/><ref name="Chan et al">{{cite journal|last1=Chan|first1=YA|last2=Aristizabal|first2=MJ|last3=Lu|first3=PY|last4=Luo|first4=Z|last5=Hamza|first5=A|last6=Kobor|first6=MS|last7=Stirling|first7=PC|last8=Hieter|first8=P|title=Genome-wide profiling of yeast DNA:RNA hybrid prone sites with DRIP-chip.|journal=PLoS genetics|date=April 2014|volume=10|issue=4|pages=e1004288|pmid=24743342}}</ref><ref name="Chaudhuri et al">{{cite journal|last1=Chaudhuri|first1=J|last2=Tian|first2=M|last3=Khuong|first3=C|last4=Chua|first4=K|last5=Pinaud|first5=E|last6=Alt|first6=FW|title=Transcription-targeted DNA deamination by the AID antibody diversification enzyme.|journal=Nature|date=17 April 2003|volume=422|issue=6933|pages=726–30|pmid=12692563}}</ref>. They are preferentially localized at [[CpG site|CpG island]] promoters in human cells and highly transcribed regions in wild-type yeast<ref name="Ginno et al 2012"/><ref name="Chan et al"/>.

Under abnormal conditions, namely elevated production of DNA-RNA hybrids, R-loops can cause genome instability by exposing single-stranded DNA to endogenous damages exerted by the action of enzymes such as [[Activation-induced cytidine deaminase|AID]] and [[APOBEC]], or overexposure to chemically reactive species<ref name="Chaudhuri et al"/>. Thus, the knowledge of where and in what circumstances R-loops are formed across the genome are crucial information for the better understanding of genome instability and their consequences for the cell. R-loop characterization was initially limited to locus specific approaches<ref name="Yu et al">{{cite journal|last1=Yu|first1=K|last2=Chedin|first2=F|last3=Hsieh|first3=CL|last4=Wilson|first4=TE|last5=Lieber|first5=MR|title=R-loops at immunoglobulin class switch regions in the chromosomes of stimulated B cells.|journal=Nature immunology|date=May 2003|volume=4|issue=5|pages=442–51|pmid=12679812}}</ref>. However, upon the arrival of [[massive parallel sequencing]] technologies and thereafter derivatives like DRIP-seq, the possibility to investigate entire genomes for R-loops opened up.

DRIP-seq relies on the high specificity and affinity the S9.6 [[monoclonal antibody]] (mAb) towards DNA-RNA hybrids of various lengths. S9.6 mAb was first discovered and characterized in 1986 and is currently used for the selective immunoprecipitation of R-loops<ref name="Boguslawski et al">{{cite journal|last1=Boguslawski|first1=SJ|last2=Smith|first2=DE|last3=Michalak|first3=MA|last4=Mickelson|first4=KE|last5=Yehle|first5=CO|last6=Patterson|first6=WL|last7=Carrico|first7=RJ|title=Characterization of monoclonal antibody to DNA.RNA and its application to immunodetection of hybrids.|journal=Journal of immunological methods|date=1 May 1986|volume=89|issue=1|pages=123–30|pmid=2422282}}</ref>. Since then it was used in diverse immunoprecipitation methods for R-loop characterization<ref name="Ginno et al 2012"/><ref name="Chan et al"/><ref name="Ginno et al 2013">{{cite journal|last1=Ginno|first1=PA|last2=Lim|first2=YW|last3=Lott|first3=PL|last4=Korf|first4=I|last5=Chédin|first5=F|title=GC skew at the 5' and 3' ends of human genes links R-loop formation to epigenetic regulation and transcription termination.|journal=Genome research|date=October 2013|volume=23|issue=10|pages=1590–600|pmid=23868195}}</ref><ref name="Skourti-Stathaki et al">{{cite journal|last1=Skourti-Stathaki|first1=K|last2=Proudfoot|first2=NJ|last3=Gromak|first3=N|title=Human senataxin resolves RNA/DNA hybrids formed at transcriptional pause sites to promote Xrn2-dependent termination.|journal=Molecular cell|date=24 June 2011|volume=42|issue=6|pages=794–805|pmid=21700224}}</ref>. DRIP-seq is in essence a variant of [[ChIP-sequencing]] where R-loop fragments are the main immunoprecipitated material. After purification, washing and elution of the R-loop-containing nucleic acids, the fragments are further sheared for size selection and ligated to adapters for high-throughput sequencing.

==Uses and Current Research==
DRIP-seq was first used for genome-wide profiling of R-loop in human, which showed widespread R-loop formation at CpG island promoters<ref name="Ginno et al 2012"/>. Particularly, the researchers found that R-loop formation is associated with the unmethylated state of CpG islands.

It was later used to profile R-loop formation at transcription start and termination sites in human pluripotent [[NTERA-2|Ntera2 cells]]<ref name="Ginno et al 2013"/>. In this study, the researchers revealed that R-loops on 3' ends of genes may be correlated with transcription termination.

==Workflow of DRIP-seq==
[[File:Workflow_of_DRIP-sequencing.svg|thumbnail|right|512px|Workflow of DRIP-seq]]

===Genomic DNA extraction===
First, [[Genomic DNA|genomic DNA]] (gDNA) is extracted from cells of interest by proteinase K treatment followed by [[phenol-chloroform extraction]] and [[Ethanol precipitation|ethanol precipitation]]. Additional zymolyase digestion is necessary for yeast cells to remove the cell wall prior to [[proteinase K]] treatment. gDNA can also be extracted with a variety of other methods, such as [[Spin column-based nucleic acid purification|column-based methods]].

===Genomic DNA fragmentation===
gDNA is treated with [[Aspergillus nuclease S1|S1 nuclease]] to remove undesired ssDNA and [[RNA]], followed by ethanol precipitation to remove the S1 nuclease. Then, gDNA is fragmented with [[Restriction enzyme|restriction endonuclease]], yielding double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) fragments of different sizes. Alternatively, gDNA fragments can be generated by [[sonication]].

===Immunoprecipitation===
Fragmented gDNA is incubated with the DNA-RNA structure-specific S9.6 antibody. This step is unique for the DRIP-seq protocol, since it entirely relies on the high specificity and affinity of the S9.6 monoclonal antibody for DNA-RNA hybrids. The antibody will recognize and bind these regions dispersed across the [[Genome|genome]] and will be used for immunoprecipitation. The S9.6 antibodies are bound to magnetic beads by interacting with specific ligands (i.e. [[protein A]] or [[protein G]]) on the surface of the beads. Thus, the DNA-RNA containing fragments will bind to the beads by means of the antibody.

===Elution===
The magnetic beads are washed to remove any gDNA not bound to the beads by a series of washes and DNA-RNA hybrids are recovered by elution. To remove the antibody bound to the nucleic acid hybrids, proteinase K treatment is performed followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. This results in the isolation of purified DNA-RNA hybrids of different sizes.

===Sequencing===
For massive parallel sequencing of these fragments, the immunoprecipitated material is sonicated, size selected and ligated to barcoded [[Oligonucleotide|oligonucleotide]] adaptors for cluster enrichment and sequencing.

==Computational Analysis==
To detect sites of R-loop formation, the hundreds of millions of sequencing reads from DRIP-seq are first aligned to a [[reference genome]] with a [[List_of_sequence_alignment_software#Short-Read_Sequence_Alignment|short-read sequence aligner]], then [[Peak_calling|peak calling]] methods designed for ChIP-seq can be used to evaluate DRIP signals<ref name="Ginno et al 2012"/>. If different cocktails of restriction enzymes were used for different DRIP-seq experiments of the same sample, consensus DRIP-seq peaks are called<ref name="Ginno et al 2013"/>. Typically, peaks are compared against those from a corresponding RNase H1-treated sample, which serves as an input control<ref name="Ginno et al 2012"/><ref name="Ginno et al 2013"/>.

==Limitations==
Typical short-read sequencing platforms would produce uneven read coverage in GC-rich regions. Sequencing long R-loops might pose a challenge because R-loops are predominantly formed in cytosine-rich DNA regions. Moreover, GC-rich regions tend to have low complexity by nature, which is difficult for short read aligners to produce unique alignments.

==Other R-loop Profiling Methods==
Although several other methods for the analysis and profiling of R-loop formation exist<ref name="Yu et al"/><ref name="El Hage et al">{{cite journal|last1=El Hage|first1=A|last2=French|first2=SL|last3=Beyer|first3=AL|last4=Tollervey|first4=D|title=Loss of Topoisomerase I leads to R-loop-mediated transcriptional blocks during ribosomal RNA synthesis.|journal=Genes & development|date=15 July 2010|volume=24|issue=14|pages=1546–58|pmid=20634320}}</ref><ref name="Duquette et al">{{cite journal|last1=Duquette|first1=ML|last2=Huber|first2=MD|last3=Maizels|first3=N|title=G-rich proto-oncogenes are targeted for genomic instability in B-cell lymphomas.|journal=Cancer research|date=15 March 2007|volume=67|issue=6|pages=2586–94|pmid=17363577}}</ref><ref name="Huertas et al">{{cite journal|last1=Huertas|first1=P|last2=Aguilera|first2=A|title=Cotranscriptionally formed DNA:RNA hybrids mediate transcription elongation impairment and transcription-associated recombination.|journal=Molecular cell|date=September 2003|volume=12|issue=3|pages=711–21|pmid=14527416}}</ref><ref name="Drolet et al">{{cite journal|last1=Drolet|first1=M|last2=Bi|first2=X|last3=Liu|first3=LF|title=Hypernegative supercoiling of the DNA template during transcription elongation in vitro.|journal=The Journal of biological chemistry|date=21 January 1994|volume=269|issue=3|pages=2068–74|pmid=8294458}}</ref><ref name="Gómez-González et al">{{cite journal|last1=Gómez-González|first1=B|last2=Aguilera|first2=A|title=Activation-induced cytidine deaminase action is strongly stimulated by mutations of the THO complex.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=15 May 2007|volume=104|issue=20|pages=8409–14|pmid=17488823}}</ref><ref name="Pohjoismäki et al">{{cite journal|last1=Pohjoismäki|first1=JL|last2=Holmes|first2=JB|last3=Wood|first3=SR|last4=Yang|first4=MY|last5=Yasukawa|first5=T|last6=Reyes|first6=A|last7=Bailey|first7=LJ|last8=Cluett|first8=TJ|last9=Goffart|first9=S|last10=Willcox|first10=S|last11=Rigby|first11=RE|last12=Jackson|first12=AP|last13=Spelbrink|first13=JN|last14=Griffith|first14=JD|last15=Crouch|first15=RJ|last16=Jacobs|first16=HT|last17=Holt|first17=IJ|title=Mammalian mitochondrial DNA replication intermediates are essentially duplex but contain extensive tracts of RNA/DNA hybrid.|journal=Journal of molecular biology|date=16 April 2010|volume=397|issue=5|pages=1144–55|pmid=20184890}}</ref><ref name="Mischo et al">{{cite journal|last1=Mischo|first1=HE|last2=Gómez-González|first2=B|last3=Grzechnik|first3=P|last4=Rondón|first4=AG|last5=Wei|first5=W|last6=Steinmetz|first6=L|last7=Aguilera|first7=A|last8=Proudfoot|first8=NJ|title=Yeast Sen1 helicase protects the genome from transcription-associated instability.|journal=Molecular cell|date=7 January 2011|volume=41|issue=1|pages=21–32|pmid=21211720}}</ref><ref name="Wahba et al">{{cite journal|last1=Wahba|first1=L|last2=Amon|first2=JD|last3=Koshland|first3=D|last4=Vuica-Ross|first4=M|title=RNase H and multiple RNA biogenesis factors cooperate to prevent RNA:DNA hybrids from generating genome instability.|journal=Molecular cell|date=23 December 2011|volume=44|issue=6|pages=978–88|pmid=22195970}}</ref>, only few provide coverage and robustness at the genome-wide scale <ref name="Ginno et al 2012"/><ref name="Chan et al"/>.

*'''Non-denaturing bisulfite modification and sequencing''': This method comprises of [[Bisulfite sequencing|bisulfite treatment followed by sequencing]] and relies on the mutagenic effect of sodium bisulfite on ssDNA. Although this method is primarily used to localize specific CpG island promoters <ref name="Ginno et al 2012"/>, it was used to detect R-loops at a minor scale<ref name="Yu et al"/> and other ssDNA fragile sites<ref name="Chan K et al">{{cite journal|last1=Chan|first1=K|last2=Sterling|first2=JF|last3=Roberts|first3=SA|last4=Bhagwat|first4=AS|last5=Resnick|first5=MA|last6=Gordenin|first6=DA|title=Base damage within single-strand DNA underlies in vivo hypermutability induced by a ubiquitous environmental agent.|journal=PLoS genetics|date=2012|volume=8|issue=12|pages=e1003149|pmid=23271983}}</ref>.

*'''DNA:RNA In Vitro Enrichment (DRIVE-seq)'''<ref name="Ginno et al 2012"/>: This method follows very similar principles of DRIP-seq except for the use of MBP-RNASEH1 instead of the S9.6 mAb for R-loops recovery. MBP-RNASEH1 may provide a good alternative to S9.6 mAb when an additional capture assay is needed.

*'''DNA:RNA immnunoprecipitation followed by hybridization on tiling microarray (DRIP-chip)'''<ref name="Chan et al"/>: This method also relies on the use of the S9.6 mAb. However, instead of entering into a sequencing pipeline, the immunoprecipitated material in DRIP-chip is hybridized to a [[microarray]]. The rapid obtention of the data is an advantage comparing to DRIP-seq. The number of probes on the chip microarrays and no DNA sequence information are the limiting factors of this technique.
